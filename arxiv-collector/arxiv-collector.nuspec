    <description>arxiv-collector for Windows - A little Python script to collect LaTeX sources for upload to the arXiv.

## Usage

Use with `arxiv-collector` from your project's main directory, or `arxiv-collector file.tex` if you have more than one .tex file and it can't guess correctly which one to use; `arxiv-collector --help` for more.

## Requirements:

* A working installation of [`latexmk`](http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8/software/latexmk/), on your PATH. (This is used to make the `.bbl` file and to track which files are used.)
  * If you have working TeX and Perl installations, you likely already have `latexmk` even if you don't use it. If you don't, you can either install it the "normal" way (`tmlgr install latexmk`, `apt-get install latexmk`, ...), or just grab the script with `arxiv-collector --get-latexmk path/to/output/latexmk`.
  * If `latexmk` isn't on your PATH for whatever reason, add `--latexmk ./path/to/latexmk` to your `arxiv-collector` call.
  * **NOTE:** `latexmk` version 4.63b has broken dependency tracking, which means `arxiv-collector` won't work with it. You can either update it with your package manager, or you can get a working version, e.g. 4.64a, with `arxiv-collector --get-latexmk path/to/output/latexmk`, and either put it in e.g. `~/bin` or pass `--latexmk` to your `arxiv-collector` invocations.


## Caveats

The script may or may not work if you do something weird with your project layout / etc; always check that the arXiv output pdf looks right. [Let me know](https://github.com/djsutherland/arxiv-collector/issues/new) if you run into any problems, including a copy of the not-working project if possible.

In particular, if you include figures or other files with absolute paths (`\includegraphics{/home/me/wow.png}` instead of `\includegraphics{../wow.png}`), the script will think it's a system file and not include it by default. You can hack it with `--include-packages` to include any directory name in the path.
