    <summary>The Ipe extensible drawing editor for Windows</summary>
    <description>Ipe is a drawing editor for creating figures in PDF format. It supports making small figures for inclusion into LaTeX-documents as well as making multi-page PDF presentations.

### Features

* Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to enter mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of the main document. In the display text is displayed as it will appear in the figure.
* Produces pure PDF, including the text. Ipe converts the LaTeX-source to PDF when the file is saved.
* It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for instance, to place a point on the intersection of two lines, or to draw a circle through three given points) using various snapping modes.
* Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add functionality to Ipe. This way, Ipe can be extended for each task at hand.
* Ipe can be compiled for Unix, Windows, and OSX.
* Ipe is written in standard C++ and Lua 5.3..
